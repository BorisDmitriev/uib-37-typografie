                            Typographic Style</a></h3>

                    <p class="author">by Robert Bringhurst</p>

                    <p class="a-text">
                        Often referred to as "The Typographer's Bible," Chapter 6 of
                        <strong><em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em></strong> covers
                        Choosing and Combining Type. Bringhurst reminds us to "Choose faces
                        that will survive, and if possible prosper, in the final screen
                        conditions" and to "choose faces that suit the task as well as the
                        subject." He tells us to "start with a single typographic family," but
                        when the time comes to combine fonts, "balance the type optically more
                        than mathematically."

                        From the website: I love Typography (ILT)
                        was born on August 7, 2007. It exists because I have a passion for
                        typography, type design, and lettering, and for the words born of
                        those disciplines. As a child I wondered why the teacher asked us to
                        draw the letter a as an o with a tail, when in my books, the a’s had
                        an extra bit at the top. This site aims to make the subject more
                        accessible, to bring the study of typography to the masses, if you
                        will. It's just about impossible to imagine a world without type, but
                        at the same time type's ubiquity has most of us taking it for granted.

                        Ben Shahn was a muralist, photographer, and printmaker whose work
                        often including lettering. When he was 14, he was apprenticed to a
                        lithographer. In
                        Love and Joy About Letters he writes: "I
                        discovered the Roman alphabet in all its elegance and its austere
                        dignity, and I fell in love all over again with letters… Letters are
                        quantities, and spaces are quantities, and only the eye and the hand
                        can measure them. As in the ear and the sensibilities of the poet
                        sounds and syllables and pauses are quantities, so in both cases are
                        the balancing and forward movement of these quantities only a matter
                        of skill and feeling and art."
